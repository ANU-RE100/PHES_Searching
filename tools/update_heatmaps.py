DESCRIPTION = """
Solar and wind play major roles in decarbonising the energy system. But where are the best sites?

In our high-resolution heat maps, an indicative cost of electricity (in AUD/MWh) is calculated for each pixel (1km x 1km for solar and 250m x 250m for wind), comprising the cost of energy from a solar/wind farm PLUS an associated powerline connecting the solar/wind farm to the existing and planned high voltage transmission network.

Access to transmission is currently the largest constraint for solar/wind farms. Heat maps identify the potential of all prospective areas close to the transmission network and are much more useful than solar and wind data alone.

Our heat maps provide detailed qualitative and quantitative information about prospective places for solar and wind farms. They balance knowledge between developers and landholders. They empower landholders and local Government to identify prospective area and facilitate collective bargaining with developers.

The maps use colours to show the lowest indicative costs for wind or solar. The example below shows the area around Tamworth for the low-cost, overhead transmission line scenario for solar farms. The lowest indicative cost is in red, pink shows the second lowest costs, and the unsuitable areas within urban areas and the surrounding National Parks are shown in green.

The commercial feasibility of developing these sites is unknown. As with all major engineering projects, diligent attention to quality assurance would be required for safety and efficacy. The publicly available datasets used for this work contain inaccuracies – results should be viewed as indicative.

There has been no investigation of land tenure apart from exclusion of some environmental areas and urban areas (which are marked as “Unsuitable” and assigned a value of 0 in the maps), and no discussions with land owners and managers. The heat maps do not imply any rights for development at any location. Accuracy of the sites depends on the accuracy of the source data. The indicative costs are assumed to be constant within a pixel, which is 1km x 1km for solar heat maps and 250m x 250m for wind heat maps. There may be pixels that are not marked as “Unsuitable” in the heat maps but fall into protected areas or urban areas that are not identified by the source data.

Only transmission lines with rating 275kV and higher were included except for Tasmania (220 kV).
Transmission constraints were not included in the study. Substation costs were not included in
indicative costs.""",
